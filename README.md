# How I Transition into Data Analytics (Self-Study Route)

_(updated on 3 Apr 2024)_

Hello, I'm Katie and I'm sharing with you my personal experience and approach to self-studying for data analytics. 

**📕 My Study Approach**
- As a **visual learner**, I prefer watching video tutorials over reading textbooks to better understand how the code works on my screen.

**🧐 What You Should Know**
- Self-studying can be **challenging** because you are on your own without any syllabus, instructors, or classmates to guide you.
- It requires resourcefulness in finding solutions and troubleshooting errors. 
- If time is a constraint, self-study may not be the best option. However, with consistency, hard work, and determination, it is achievable.

**Disclaimer**: I'm not an expert, just someone who is passionate about data analysis and wants to help others who are transitioning into this field.

**Another important note:** I'm not sponsored to recommend any of the courses mentioned below.

## How and Where to Start?

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in starting a career in data analytics, but don't know where to begin or whether it's the right path for you. I totally get it - I was once in your shoes! 🧐

To start, I recommend taking a **general data analytics course**, like the [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or the [IBM Data Analyst](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?) course. I started with Google's course as it was released more recently. I'm not sponsored for both courses.

Both courses provides:
- An **overview of data analytics**
- An **introduction of the skills/tools** you need to learn
- Flexible, study-at-your-own-pace courses
- Relatively inexpensive. You can apply for financial aid and study for free.

You can enroll in both courses on Coursera for around USD 20-40/month. I paid USD 39/month for Google's course last year, but a friend recently only paid USD 20+/month.

On average, people complete the course in 2 to 4 months, and the faster you complete it, the less you pay. 😇

**💡 My Experience**

I found Google's course to be very helpful, especially since I'm a visual learner. However, please note that the courses only teach basic Spreadsheet, R, BigQuery (SQL), and Tableau, so you'll need to take additional courses to gain more in-depth knowledge.

**‼️IMPORTANT‼️** 
- The course claims that you'll learn everything you need to know to be job-ready. That is not true. 🥲
- What you learn from this course is **NOT ENOUGH to get an entry-level job** or pass a technical interview.
- At most, the course contributed to 5% or less in my learning.  

Thus, I'm sharing the following resources to help you continue your studies after completing the course. 

## My Advice on Technical Skills to Learn

In my opinion, you should focus on these three skills in the following order:
1. SQL
2. Tableau (or Power BI)
3. Python & Statistics

I found SQL to be the **easiest and most essential skill** for any data analyst role. It's a crucial language for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data. Once you understand SQL, you'll have an easier time learning other tools like Tableau, which relies on SQL for creating calculated fields.

Python is also an essential skill, particularly if you're pursuing a data scientist or data engineer role. However, it's not always a requirement for data analysts. In some companies, it's only a good-to-have skill, while in others, it's a must-have. I recommend becoming proficient in Python if you're planning to pursue a career in these fields.

# 🏕️ Bootcamp

I highly recommend checking out Alex the Analyst's free [data analyst bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF) on YouTube. Alex is a well-known expert in the data analysis community, and his resources are top-notch.

This bootcamp covers a range of tools, including SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. It's an excellent resource if you're new to data analytics or want to improve your skills in any of these tools.

In my experience, Alex's instruction has helped me develop my own data analysis skills, and I believe you'll find his bootcamp to be a valuable resource.
